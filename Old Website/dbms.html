Database management systems are now an indispensable tool for managing
information, and a course on the principles and practice of database systems
is now an integral part of computer science curricula.</p><p>
A database management system, or DBMS, is software designed to assist
in maintaining and utilizing large collections of data. The need for such systems,
as well as their use, is growing rapidly. The alternative to using a DBMS is
to store the data in files and write application-specific code to manage it.
</p><p>
<h2>*Features of DBMS:</h2>
1.Data Independence: Application programs should not, ideally, be exposed
to details of data representation and storage.<br>
2.Efficient Data Access: A DBMS utilizes a variety of sophisticated techniques
to store and retrieve data efficiently.<br>
3.Data Integrity and Security: If data is always accessed through the
DBMS, the DBMS can enforce integrity constraints.<br>
4.Data Administration: When several users share the data, centralizing
the administration of data can offer sig11ificant improvements.<br>
5.Concurrent Access and Crash Recovery: A DBMS schedules concurrent
accesses to the data in such a manner that users can think of the data
as being accessed by only one user at a time.<br>
6.Reduced Application Development Time: Clearly, the DBMS supports
important functions that are common to many applications accessing
data in the DBMS.
