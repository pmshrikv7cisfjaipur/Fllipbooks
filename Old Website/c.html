Objective-C is a combination of the C and Smalltalk programming languages with
Smalltalk’s object support added.TomLove and Brad Cox developed this system in
the 80s. Its popularity grew with the rise of Steve Jobs’s NeXT systems in 1988, and
it is currently most prevalent in Apple Mac OS X.</p><p> Unlike other OO systems at the
time, Objective-C used a very small runtime library instead of a virtual machine.
Objective-C’s influence is present in the Java programming language, and Apple’s
Objective-C 2.0 is popular for Mac OS X and iPhone applications.

<h2>*Features of Objective-C:</h2>
1.Used for creating CAD tools<br>
2.This language is used in research models or prototypes.<br>
3.Objective-C 2.0 adds a lot of interesting features—Apple is certainly keeping it alive.<br>
4.Objective-C started off life with the idea of being a
hybrid language, and we rigorously upheld the notion that we wouldn’t take away anything
from C, we would only add to it.<br>
5.The square brackets are an indication of a message sent in Objective-C.<br>
6.It is independent language.<br>
