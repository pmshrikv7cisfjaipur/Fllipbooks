java is a breed of coffee thats why we can see coffee mug in its logo.
 sun microsystem was founded by 4 people in 1982.

java was developed as a solution to a problem.
sun microsystem makes sofware for appliances, but their problem was to make a 
   platform independent language, so they developed java.

 slogan of java is "java is everywhere".
