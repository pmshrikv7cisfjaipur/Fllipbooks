<h2>*Features of CPP:</h2>
1.It is a middle level language which means it supports both high level
    language and low level langugage.<br>
 2.It supports object oriented paradigm<br>
 3.It allows runtime initialization of a variable(dynamic)<br>
 5.Message passing:the process of invoking an operation on a object.in

  the object.<br>
 6.Extensibility,encapsulation,data hiding and polymorphism<br>
7.inheritance:-it is a type of is-a relationship.<br>
 8.delegation:-it is an alternative to class inheritance.it is a way of 
              making object composition as powerfull as inheritance.it is 
        a type of has-a relationship or containership.<br>	
 9.genericity:-this allows decelaration of data items without specifying 
      their exact data types.<br>
 10.abstraction:-act of representing essential features without including
